What is this?
=============

ORKopoly is a Monopoly-like board game. Your goal is to eliminate the other players by "inviting" them to your houses (green fields) and
overwhelm them with quickly rising rent costs. To upgrade your houses (and thereby the rent), you'll need stone from your quarries (grey
fields). You'll also need food from your farms (brown fields) to keep your guests fed. And last but not least, electricity from your
power plants (yellow fields) to run the fridge, because you can't offer your guests warm beer, right?
