What is this?
------------------

ORKopoly is a Monopoly-like board game. Your goal is to eliminate the other players by "inviting" them to your houses (green fields) and
overwhelming them with quickly rising rent costs. To upgrade your houses (and thereby the rent), you'll need stone from your quarries
(grey fields). You'll also need food from your farms (brown fields) to keep your guests fed. And last but not least, electricity from
your power plants (yellow fields) to run the fridge, because you can't offer your guests warm beer, right?

How to run it
---------------------

If you never used "git pull", try the folowing:

1) download "orkopoly.py" and the folder "py/" and save it to the same directory, e.g. "D:/games/orkopoly/"
2) open a command prompt and move to the folder from step 1 using "cd"
3) run "python orkopoly.py"

The game should now ask you for your names. If you are less than four players, leave some fields empty.
